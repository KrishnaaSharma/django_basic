1.First we will create a project of template_inheritance

2.Then we will copy the core app from the adding_bootstrap project and paste it in the template_inheritance project

3.Then we will add the core app in the installed app in setting.py in template_inheritance

Install the app - go to settings.py inside template folder and add name of the apps inside the list of 
                     INSTALLED_APPS = [
                                            'django.contrib.admin',
                                            'django.contrib.auth',
                                            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
                                            'django.contrib.sessions',
                                            'django.contrib.messages',
                                            'django.contrib.staticfiles',
                                            'core,
                                      ]
4. In core app we will create index.html, base.html, about.html, contact.html, number.html, footer.html files under core folder under template folder.

 Now create html file inside templates folder of dc app
   templates
     |-core
       |- index.html
       |- base.html
       |- about.html
       |- contact.html
       |- footer.html
       |- navbar.html

5.view me template ko load krenge

from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.

def index(request):
    return render(request, 'core/index.html')

def about(request):
    return render(request, 'core/about.html')


def contact(request):
    return render(request, 'core/contact.html')

6. Now route url in urls.py file of core apps.

7. Defining in urls.py of core app 

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index),
    path('about/', views.about),
    path('contact/', views.contact),
]


8. Defining in urls.py of dc app

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('core.urls')),
]

9. For example there is footer in index then I want footer in sub page then we use extended function which we don't need to write code of footer in that page
Contact me about this just use extended function and that structure will come
parent table index.html

This means that this template is extending the parent template named core/index.html .

{% extends "core/index.html" %}

10. Include the function, it is used for include in the file like just about it, include in the index file then tab, we use include function

{% include "core/about.html" %}

11. python manage.py runserver
